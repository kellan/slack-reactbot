Bot to perform the very important task of tabulating which reactji's a person recieves on a given Slack team.

Uses the excellent [slackbots](https://github.com/kellan/slack-bot-api) library, but currently relies on my (lightly) forked version.  Sticks the data in Redis.  

This project represents about an hour of coding, and an hour of debugging mostly done at a bar -- with whisky. It's ugly and hacky and was written to troll a particular channel that said they didn't like such things in IRC.

But people asked for the source, so here it is.
